# Additional C++ Tasks

This section summarizes three additional C++ programs that demonstrate basic control structures, user input handling, and character analysis.

## Tasks Overview

### Conditional Expression Evaluation
A C++ program that takes an input value `x` from the user and evaluates the expression `Y` based on the value of `x` using the following conditions:

- **If** `x ≤ -10` → \( Y = x^3 + x \)
- **If** `x ≥ 10` → \( Y = 4x \)
- **If** `-10 < x < 10` → \( Y = \frac{(x + 1)^2}{2} \)

The program determines and displays the appropriate result based on the range of `x`.

### Simple Calculator
A C++ program that simulates a basic calculator. It takes two integers and an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`) as input from the user, then outputs the complete expression along with the result.

#### Features:
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Includes error handling for division by zero.

#### Example Output:
50 + 5 = 55 Cannot divide by zero.

### Character Case Checker
A C++ program that reads a single character from the user and checks whether it is a lowercase letter. It then prints an appropriate message indicating the result.

#### Example Output:
Input: S → Your character is not a small letter. Input: s → Your chracter is a small letter.
