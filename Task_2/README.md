# Project Tasks - C++ Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple yet effective C++ programs designed to perform specific computational and input/output tasks. Each program implements a distinct functionality, aiming to enhance programming proficiency and problem-solving skills.

## Tasks Overview

### Compute the Value of F
A C++ program that computes the value of the following mathematical expression:



\[ F = x - y + 3 + 4z + 10 \]



The program prompts the user to enter values for `x`, `y`, and `z`, then calculates and displays the result.

### Reverse Character Sequence
A C++ program that accepts four characters as input (e.g., `p`, `@`, `+`, `1`) and prints them in reverse order, separated by underscores.

#### Example Output:
