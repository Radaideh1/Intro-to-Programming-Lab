# Interactive C++ Programs with Menu System

This section introduces interactive C++ programs that utilize loops, conditions, and menus to perform specific tasks based on user input.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Print Multiples of X  
A C++ program that reads two integers `X` and `N` from the user (`N > 1`), and prints all multiples of `X` in the range from **1 to N**.

### 2. Count Letters and Digits  
A C++ program that continuously reads characters from the keyboard until the symbol `@` is entered.  
It counts and displays the number of:

- **Letters** (both uppercase and lowercase)
- **Digits** (`0-9`)

### 3. Compute a Mathematical Series  
A C++ program that computes a mathematical series. The value of `n` is specified by the user. *(The exact formula was not included in the task description, so it is assumed to be implemented in code as per instructor’s specification.)*

### 4. Menu-Driven Program  
A C++ program that displays the following menu repeatedly in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit:

```
Main Menu ---------------
1. Print Multiples of X
2. Count number of letters and digits
3. Calculate series
4. Exit
Please enter your choice:
```

- **Choice 1–3**: Executes the corresponding program described above.
- **Choice 4**: Terminates the program.
