# Loop and Data Processing Tasks - C++ Programs

This section outlines a set of C++ programs focused on loops, conditionals, and data analysis using user input.

## Tasks Overview

### Sum of Even Numbers & Product of Odd Numbers
A C++ program that prompts the user to enter a limit value and then calculates:
- The sum of all even integers starting from `4` up to the given limit.
- The product of all odd integers starting from `3` up to the same limit.

### Find Maximum of Ten Numbers
A C++ program that reads ten numbers entered by the user and determines the maximum value among them.

### Count Vowels in a Sequence
A C++ program that continuously reads a sequence of characters from the user and counts the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) present in the input.
- The input sequence terminates when the user enters the character `!`.

### Average of Student Marks
A C++ program that reads the marks of 10 students, calculates the average, and displays the result to the user.
